                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The hangman game is a digital replica of the classic hangman game. The program is a C-based hangman game that reads words from a file. 
                    Players guess letters to reveal a hidden word, with incorrect guesses counting toward a 6-strike limit. 
                    A special feature allows players to attempt guessing the full word after two consecutive correct letter guesses. 
                    The game runs round-by-round with an option to continue or quit after each word.</p>
